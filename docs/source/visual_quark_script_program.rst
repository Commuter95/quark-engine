Visual Quark Script Program
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Introduction of the Program
----------------------------

Quark Script is a powerful tool for detecting and analyzing mobile security. However, it can be complex and challenging for user who are not familiar with programming. To overcome this challenge, we are pleased to announce our plan to develop a visual programming tool that simplifies the Quark Script organization process, making it easy for anyone to organize Quark Script using a simple UI interface.

Goal of the Program
--------------------

We aim to make Quark Script programming accessible to everyone and remove the barriers that often come with traditional programming languages. So we design a new visual tool for Quark Script organization. It would be more intuitive, time-saving, and effort-saving for users, even if they are not familiar with programming.

Web Design Layout
------------------

The initial draft of the web design is as below.

The website's initial design concept
-------------------------------------

The website is structured into five distinct sections. At the top of the site, you'll find the navigation bar, which showcases Quark documents and social media links. Just beneath the navigation bar lies the visual Quark Script workspace, allowing you to seamlessly drag Quark Script APIs from the left panel to the central workspace for API assembly. The resulting program can be previewed in the bottom right panel, enabling you to copy it and run it on your local computer. Additionally, in the top right panel, you can fine-tune the parameters of the APIs.

If you're unfamiliar with how Quark Script APIs work, you can easily switch to the CWE examples tab on the left panel. From there, you can select a CWE example and customize it by dragging more Quark Script APIs or adjusting parameters as needed.
